# Vendor onboarding checklist

## Purpose

This document supports the Division of Public Assistance Eligibility
Information System Modernization (EIS-M) Project. Specifically, this
document addresses our agile acquisition practice and onboarding new
vendor staff. Within agile acquisition, we anticipate bringing in a
potentially different vendor every three to four months, possibly more
often when we begin running multiple acquisitions simultaneously. With
short timelines, this onboarding checklist will bring new vendor staff
up to speed as quickly as possible.

# Audience

This document intends to inform EIS-M State of Alaska project staff and
the vendors we engage with in various product-increment acquisitions.

# Roles

This section identifies the anticipated vendor roles that will be
engaged with the
project.

# Access procedures

This section outlines procedures to grant access. Access to DOH managed
resources must be formally requested, sponsored and granted. All vendor
access requests must be submitted through the EIS-M PMO.
